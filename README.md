# AWS Security Call

It is important for compliance and security that in the event of critical security alerts, the security team is promptly notified. In the event of the highest level security alerts (such as CRITICAL GuardDuty findings) a member from the security team should recieve a call. This solution was created to improve security in AWS and properly notify the correct team, improving compliance, in the event of important security alerts.

## Verify GuardDuty

To start, verify that GuardDuty is properly enabled in the environment. GuardDuty can be centralized with a delegated adminsistrator, or simply enabled in one AWS account.
